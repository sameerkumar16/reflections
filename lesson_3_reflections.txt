   When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   
    It's important if you want a project which have multiple programmers working on
    their local sysstems .

   Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
   stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   
    Because we want to be sure of what changes are going to be added on local repository.
    If it is automatic then we lose some control.

   Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
   instead of another?
  
   Fork is a GitHub invention .It is used to directly clone from one repository to others
   on GitHub servers.Clone is the copy of any git repository .If it's on github then I 
   use Fork else Clone.
