    What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

       It makes a .git file ,but there will be no commits made and running
       git status will show the the untracked files and no commit id's since 
       we haven't made any commits.

    How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
    repository? What value do you think it offers?
       
       Staging area is intermediate between repository and working 
       directory.On any file or files you want to add to git 
       repository .You can do by "git add" .It adds the files from
       working directory to staging area and from here you can add
       to git repository by "git commit".
     
    How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
    logical change?
     
       By adding all the changes made to working directory contributes 
       to a single logical change .We can add those files to staging 
       area one by one or all at once .And finally commit at once.
    
    What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping 
    your history organized? How would branches help?
   
     There are no. of situations in where tha application of branches
     could be used for example like whe trying some exceptional feature
     or localizing for different language etc. In short if you don't 
     want main branch to get disturbed .

    How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure? 
    
      It helps by dnoting the parent of each commit and further 
      shows us reachability of all the commits.
