    What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

       It makes a .git file ,but there will be no commits made and running
       git status will show the the untracked files and no commit id's since 
       we haven't made any commits.

    How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
    repository? What value do you think it offers?
       
       Staging area is intermediate between repository and working 
       directory.On any file or files you want to add to git 
       repository .You can do by "git add" .It adds the files from
       working directory to staging area and from here you can add
       to git repository by "git commit".
