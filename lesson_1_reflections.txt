How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The diff command made spotting the difference made between two versions of
    the file easy to spot.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will help me spot differences made in different versions very easily .
    So it would save a lot of time and effort.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    More power to users and more control on the versions.One should commit when
    there is some logical change in the files .It should not be automatic.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git serves as a version control tool for a code repository ,in which 
    commits are made to multiple files for a single logical change which is not 
    the same in Google docs etc.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use it to see the commit history of the projects and see what exact 
    changes were made to the files and what files were changed .It helps in 
    debugging and feature adding.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because i would always be sure that in any situation I can revert to 
    previous version .So it always give me freedom to explore more and not 
    be wary of the code reusability.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to setup git on my Android projects,And also need to know how
    to do that with ease .
